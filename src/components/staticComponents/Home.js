                            My name is Sabita Silwal, an MSGIS student at the Department of
                             Geography in the University of Utah, graduating in
                             May 2019. I have been working as a Research/Data Analyst at the
                             Energy and Geoscience Institute since 2013. I work with the
                              Biostratigraphy group and help in their projects where I
                              digitize biostratigraphic data and make graphical plots of
                              biostratigraphic and geochemical data along with making some
                            maps.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When I was undergraduate student, I worked in a project
                        related to Ancient Lake Bonneville and first bumped into
                        GIS where I had to use Lidar data and aerial photographs
                        to make maps. I really liked all the features and
                        capabilities of ArcGIS Desktop and decided to further my
                        knowledge of GIS. Thatâ€™s how I found myself enrolling
                        in MSGIS.
